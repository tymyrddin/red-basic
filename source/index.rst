Grove
=================================

To start off in the red team as someone without hacking experience, we recommend following a story of a small grove
in the forest. The tips of the trees' branches are entrypoints to discovering the trunk and then the roots of the
trees, and from there the network of near-infinite and interwoven fungi threads and roots that connect all the trees,
the mycorrhizal network or 'wood web'.

By following the plots in each section, you can get an impression of the grove, and by extension, of the forest.
