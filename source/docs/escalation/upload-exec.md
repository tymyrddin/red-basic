# Upload and execute using empire

## Attack tree

```text
1 Using empire > upload [full/path/to/payload/on/kali] (for example a compiled veil evasion backdoor)
2 Start the with the payload matching listener (then would be with metasploit msfconsole)
3 Using empire > shell ./[name payload]
```

## Notes

* Can be used to upload and execute Lazagne too. Doesn't need a listener ofcourse, but downloading result afterwards.
