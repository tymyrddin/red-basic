# Exploit code execution vulnerabilities

## Attack tree

```text

1 Create a reverse shell with netcat installed on both systems (hacking and target machines).
    1.1 Install netcat on both systems
    1.2 Setup a netcat listener on the hacking machine
    1.3 Connect to the listener from the target machine
    1.4 Send command to the target machine from the hacking machine
2 Create a reverse shell without netcat on the target machine
    2.1 Install netcat on hacking machine and discover an existing option on target 
    2.2 Setup a netcat listener on the hacking machine
    2.3 Connect to the listener from the target machine (see cheatsheet reverse shell commands)
    2.4 Send command to the target machine from the hacking machine
```

## Notes

A reverse shell is a shell initiated on a target machine making it a server sending back to the adversaries' machine, 
which is now a client in a listening state waiting to pick up the shell.

Setting up a reverse shell with Netcat installed on both the hacking and target machine is easy. Unfortunately, most of 
the time, a target does not have Netcat installed on their system, and other means are required to launch a reverse 
shell. We can still set one up using Bash, Python, Perl, Ruby, PHP.
