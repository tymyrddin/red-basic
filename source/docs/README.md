# On the grove and the forest

To start off in the red team as someone without hacking experience, we recommend following a story of a small grove
in the forest first. The tips of the trees' branches are entrypoints to discovering the trunk and then the roots of the
trees, and from there the network of near-infinite and interwoven fungi threads and roots that connect all the trees,
the mycorrhizal network or 'wood web'.

By following the plots in each section, you can get an impression of [the grove](lab/README.md), and by extension, of 
the forest. After reading and grokking the concepts of such a systematic hack, you have some ground to stand on and 
explore more detail, or walk around and visit the rest of the forest.

Or both. The red team tries out all kinds of details in [the forest](forest/README.md). Red teaming is not so much finding and exploiting
vulnerabilities in a given scope, limited to digital assets, although it includes some of that. Red teaming involves
finding and exploiting only those vulnerabilities that help to achieve measuring how well people and networks,
applications, and physical security controls can withstand an attack from a roleplayed real-life adversary.
