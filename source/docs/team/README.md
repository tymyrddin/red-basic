# Introduction

## What?

Red teaming is a full-scope, multi-layered attack simulation, in the forest.

## Why?

Measure how well people and networks, applications, and physical security controls can withstand an attack from a real-life adversary.

* Flexible methodologies
* The security teams of the organisations have no information about it happening
* Attacks can happen 24/7
* Measure the impact of the vulnerabilities

## How?

By role playing a likely adversary and adopting their ways of thinking, working, and tools. 

[In the grove](../lab/README.md) we have been using tools such as the Metasploit Framework, routersploit, enumeration 
tools, nmap, and so on for post-exploitation and scanning, and for red teaming in the wild, we will switch to another 
set of tools on a *nix-based system ([Kali](../lab/Kali.md) in our case).
