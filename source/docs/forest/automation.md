# Automating the server setup

## Terraform

Infrastructure as code uses the idea of having a full declarative description of the components 
that should be running at any given time, from the name of the machine to the last package 
installed on it. A tool then parses this description file and corrects any discrepancies observed, 
such as updating a firewall rule, changing an IP address, attaching more disk, or whatever is needed.

Terraform is open source and [supports a number of cloud providers](https://registry.terraform.io). We can SSH into
our bouncing servers and download the tool:

```text
root@Bouncer:~/# wget\
https://releases.hashicorp.com/terraform/1.2.7/terraform_1.2.7_linux_amd64.zip
root@Bouncer:~/# unzip terraform_1.2.7_linux_amd64.zip
root@Bouncer:~/# chmod +x terraform
```

Terraform will interact with the AWS Cloud using valid credentials that we provide.

## The containers

Whichever cloud provider we chose and whatever Linux distribution they host, as long as there is Docker support, we 
can spawn the fully configured C2 backends using a couple of command lines. 

The following will run our Metasploit container:

```text
root@tardis:~/# docker run -dit \
-p 9990-9999:9990-9999 \
-v $HOME/.msf4:/root/.msf4 \
-v /tmp/msf:/tmp/data phocean/msf
```

And this will run the SILENTTRINITY container:

```text
root@tardis:~/# docker run -d \
-v /opt/st:/root/st/data \
-p5000-5050:5000-5050 \
barzh/silent
```

Launching a fully functioning Nginx server that redirects traffic to the 
C2 endpoints is a one-line job:

```text
root@tardis:~/# docker run -d \
-p80:80 -p443:443 \
-e DOMAIN="www.customdomain.com" \
-e C2IP="192.168.1.29" \
-v /opt/letsencrypt:/etc/letsencrypt \
barzh/nginx
```

The DNS record of www.<customdomain>.com should already point to the serverâ€™s public IP for this to work. 
The Metasploit and SilentTrinity containers can run on the same host, but the Nginx container must run on a separate 
host. If the IP or domain gets flagged, respawn a new host and run a docker run command. Twenty seconds later, we have 
a new domain with a new IP routing to the same backends.
