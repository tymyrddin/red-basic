# Use social engineering tactics used in interrogation

## Attack tree

```text
1 Build rapport early in the engagement in order to gain trust and lower the subject's guard
2 Show genuine interest
3 Use mirroring a few words for gathering more information
4 Use labeling to figure out what is going on without directly asking
```

## Notes

When interviewing or interrogating people, a number of physical reactions to questions can be
used to identify topic areas that should lead to more questioning.
