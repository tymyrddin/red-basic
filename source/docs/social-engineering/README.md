# Introduction

## What?

Social engineering targets the weakest (and by many organisations mostly ignored) link in the security chain: people. 
It takes advantage of human weakness and trust (which can be strengths in other contexts, like being helpful) and uses 
technical as well as non-technical methods.

* Email and social media/networking
* Pharming and phishing, including vishing, whaling, and spear phishing
* Casual contact
* Eavesdropping and surveillance
* Shoulder surfing
* Dumpster diving
* Impersonation

## Why?

Goals are to gather information, gain a foothold in an organisation, circumvent security controls, and infiltrate 
security.

## How?

By targeting people, like website and network administrators, security personnel, senior executives, cleaners, etc.
