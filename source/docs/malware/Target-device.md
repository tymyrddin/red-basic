## Notes

Social engineering is all about the psychology of persuasion: It targets the mind. The aim is to gain the trust of 
targets, so they lower their guard, and then encourage them into taking unsafe actions. It:

- Targets people and non-technical processes
- May target weak physical and operational security
- Can also use some technical tools - email, websites, social media hacking, etc.
- Includes several different methods and techniques
- Requires patience, the ability to think quickly on your feet, acting ability, resourcefulness and observation skills
- Needs people skills!
