# Introduction

## What?

An API is a technology that enables communication between different applications. By relying on APIs, developers 
can design modular applications that leverage the expertise of other applications. They no longer need to create 
their own custom software to implement maps, payment processors, machine-learning algorithms, or authentication 
processes. As a result, popular! Many modern web applications have been quick to adopt APIs.

* APIs have immensely expanded applicationsâ€™ attack surfaces. 
* They are often poorly defended providing a direct route to their data. 
* Many APIs lack the security controls that other attack vectors have in place.

## Why?

* Gaining ability to execute arbitrary code.
* Gaining privileged access.
* Gaining unauthorised data access.

## How?

* [Passive reconnaissance](passive-recon.md)
* [Active reconnaissance](active-recon.md)
* [Analyse API endpoints](endpoints.md)
* [Attack authentication](authentication.md)
* [Fuzz deep and wide](fuzzing.md)
* [Exploit authorisation](authorisation.md)
* [Inject with mass assignment](mass-assignment.md)
* [Try traditional injections](traditional.md)
* [Rate limit tests](rate-limit.md)
* [Evasive techniques](evade.md)
* [Attack GraphQL](graphql.md)
