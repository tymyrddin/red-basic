# Introduction

## What?

Enumeration is listing and identifying the specific services and resources that a target offers. Take information 
already gathered during reconnaissance (like IP addresses) and during scanning (open ports) and gather as much data 
about the targets and services running on the targets, using a variety of techniques and tools.

## Why?

Move further and deeper into the scanning process to include security scanning. Enumeration is particularly successful 
in networks that contain unprotected network resources and services.
